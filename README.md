## Description

- Driver distraction problem is becoming more insane  because of increasing use of the technology and dependence on the technology. Not only more and more people are using vehicles now, but also there are distractions like smart phones, GPS system within cell phones, feature loaded car dashboards etc. Nowadays car comes with an advanced system which has interactive touch screens used for navigation and  this requires human interaction to operate. Notifications from the smart phones also play big role in distraction of the driver. Distracted driving, is a kind of driving where a driver is continuously engaged in activity or a task that takes their attention away from road and operating a vehicle, is identified to be a  significant cause of fatal motor vehicle crashes and injuries.

## Install Instructions

This is a image classifier to predict driver distraction while driving.

For more information visit https://www.kaggle.com/c/state-farm-distracted-driver-detection

Install all the dependencies after installing python by using pip.  

Install FLASK as its a flask web application usin 'pip flask install'

Create Virtual Environment and active envirnment using 'ACTIVATE'

Move all python files to vrtual environment.

Libraries installation command by using pip : "pip install -r requirement.txt".

set flask environment to developmet "set FLASK_ENV=development"

run flask "set FLASK_APP=predict.py"

FLASK run

## Usage
- After installing all the dependencies, I used Pycharm GUI to run the project.  
- This project is the web application so it will run in any operating system. after runnung the project user will get one feature and that is upload image.
- Here user can upload distraction image, according to that the given network predict the calss of the distraction.

## Support

- If you find any changes in the code, feel free to contact me. I would love to know the upgradation.

Contact: [email me](mailto:vpatel62@lakeheadu.ca)

## Road-map
- We can use mobile phone to detect distraction by using this we can reduce the cost.
- We can user other algorithm to achieve more accuracy of the model.


## Acknowledgements
I express our sincere thanks to Prof. Dr. Trevor Tomesh, of MS in Computer Science department of LAKEHEAD UNIVERSITY, for his support and guidance for this project and care taken by him in helping us to complete the project work successfully. This is to place on record our appreciation and deep gratitude to the professor. I express our sincere thanks to faculties, Head of the Department, at LAKEHEAD UNIVERSITY for extending their help. Finally, at the outset, I would like to thank all those who have directly or indirectly helped us to accomplish our project success-full

## Project Status

- In future I would like to add more features and if any other person have the similar kind of idea but with the improvment, I would contact him/her and make my project more efficient.
